Butler
======

A really simple Jenkins build notification app for Windows. Keep an eye on your builds from the system tray!


Setup
=====

Either Download the latest exe or open `butler.sln` in Visual Studio 2015 and press F5.

The settings screen will then ask for the HTTP path to your Jenkin's cc.xml e.g. `http://jenkins/cc.xml`.
